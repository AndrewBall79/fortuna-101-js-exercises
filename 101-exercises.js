// Exercise #0, Example Problem:
// Example problem setup: Create a variable named doingJavaScriptRightNow and assign it the boolean true.
// The line below creates the variable named doingJavaScriptRightNow and assigns the boolean value true
// To complete Exercise #0, uncomment the following line of JS
// var doingJavaScriptRightNow = true

// The lines below will test your answer. If you see an error, then it means that your answer is incorrect or incomplete.

// On the line below, create a variable named onMarsRightNow and assign it the boolean value of false

// Exercise 2
// Create a variable named fruits and assign it an array of strings containing the following fruits.
// mango, banana, guava, kiwi, and strawberry.
var fruits = ["mango", "banana", "guava", "kiwi", "strawberry"]

//  Exercise 3
//  Create a variable named vegetables and assign it a list of fruits containing the following vegetable names as strings: 
//  eggplant, broccoli, carrot, cauliflower, and zucchini

// Exercise 4
// Create a variable named numbers and assign it a list of numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

// Add the string "tomato" to the end of the fruits array. 
// *Hint* Recommend finding and using a built-in JS operation to add to a list rather than recreating the array.
